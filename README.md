#This is the Source Code repository of the Picture Montage made using $>_Bash integrated with imageMagick 7

#The source code to create the collage is present in montageCode.sh file

#To create the collage just clone the entire repository into your system

#Then type following two commands in your terminal

chmod +x montageCode.sh

./montageCode.sh

#This will initiate the bash script, enjoy the process on terminal and you will get the final collage in same folder after the bash script is fully executed

#Thanks
